As it\'s been a quite awhile since my last update, I figured another one was long overdue at this point. So what have I been up to?\\n\\nWell, I\'m still chugging away at the revamped Modrunner website, bringing it up to my personal standard and such. It\'s admittedly taken much longer than I would\'ve liked, due to a combination of factors. Primarily of which is that I at one point pretty much scrapped all the work I had done up until that point so I could switch the tech stack I was using. Now this might sound rather counterproductive, and this is true, to a certain extent, but let me justify myself.\\n\\nThe [current website](https://modrunner.net/) has historically served as documentation for the bot, which it has done perfectly well. The current website uses a tool called [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), which is a framework for creating simple documentation-centric websites. However, since I want the website to be able to do more, like providing an online dashboard for managing the bot, this simplicity just isn\'t going to cut it for me. While Docusaurus does technically allow you to create pages with custom logic, which is one possible way I could approach building the dashboard, it\'s not really intended to be used that way and I don\'t particularly want to spend my time fighting with my tools.\\n\\nSo instead, I\'ve elected to switch to a framework called [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), used for creating full-stack web applications. In a nutshell, that means that it\'s a tool that contains all the bells and whistles I need to build the things that I want, and doesn\'t shoehorn me into a particular way of doing things. Rest assured that haven\'t thrown out _all_ the work I\'ve done so far. Nuxt still uses Vue to construct the user interface so I can still reuse a lot of the old code to save time and effort.\\n\\nBut back to why I scrapped a lot of my existing work - this is also a part of unifying various pieces of Modrunner together. Originally, the plan for the dashboard was that it was going to be its own separate website, which you could access using a link on the documentation. This would\'ve gotten the job done, but I eventually decided that I wanted a cleaner and more cohesive experience, so instead I decided to rebuild a lot of the current website\'s functionality in Nuxt, so that the dashboard could be integrated better with the rest of the website.\\n\\nThe last part is about future-proofing. Thinking back to the original plan of having the dashboard nested within the current documentation website, doing this way means more work for me down the line. Updating something like Modrunner\'s styling would be a lot more work since it means I have to update two separate projects at the same time and be careful that I keep them in sync. Same goes for adding new functionality, I would need to update information in multiple places at once which leads to complication and complexity that I can eliminate by just having these two things, the dashboard and documentation, in one place.\\n\\nSo that\'s what\'s been happening in the world of Modrunner as of late. I believe that I can share a few new pieces and teasers of information about the new website itself, now that I have a fairly substational portion of it completed. The new website, once it leaves its initial beta period, will _completely_ replace the current website in its entirely. I will likely keep the current website around for a little while just in case, but in time it will go away for good, so if you\'re particularly emotionally attached to it for whatever reason, I recommend you prepare yourself. However, don\'t worry! All the documentation that the current website hosts will be present in the new website. In fact, here\'s an image of what a document page currently looks like:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/july-2023-dev-log/teaser2.png)\\n\\nThe homepage has also recieved a fresh coat of paint, although please ignore the giant placeholder image at the bottom (lol):\\n\\n![](/img/blog/july-2023-dev-log/teaser1.png)\\n\\nAnd lastly, the most important part, the dashboard has had most of its most subsantial work completed and is in a mostly working state. Most of the work that is left involve more mundane but nessessary stuff like tweaks to the styling and error handling. Here\'s an example of how looks now:\\n\\n![](/img/blog/july-2023-dev-log/teaser3.png)\\n\\nI appreciate that support that everyone has shown me in the recent months in terms of patience and reporting issues. Great software is always a group effort, so thank you. You help make Modrunner as great as it is as much as I do. We can celebrate a couple smaller milestones together as well, Modrunner recently surpassed being present in over 100 unique Discord servers! That also means that I was able to make Modrunner a verified Discord bot, so now it looks all official and stuff! Yay!\\n\\nOnce again, thanks and I appreciate the patience. Good things are coming!\\n\\n-beansquared"},{"id":"/2022/12/29/modrunner-recap-2022","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/12/29/modrunner-recap-2022","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-29-modrunner-recap-2022.md","title":"Modrunner End-of-Year Recap","description":"A look at the history of Modrunner and its accomplishments for 2022","date":"2022-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 29, 2022","tags":[],"readingTime":5.145,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"beansquared","title":"Modrunner Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/smcmo","imageURL":"https://github.com/smcmo.png","key":"beansquared"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Modrunner End-of-Year Recap","description":"A look at the history of Modrunner and its accomplishments for 2022","authors":"beansquared","date":"2022-12-29T00:00:00.000Z"},"prevItem":{"title":"July 2023 Dev Log","permalink":"/blog/2023/07/12/july-2023-dev-log"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Minor Update Before Christmas","permalink":"/blog/2022/12/21/minor-update-before-christmas"}},"content":"## Introduction\\n\\nHey everyone,\\n\\nSeems like this concept of an end of the year recap has been gaining popularity in recent years, with the most notable\\nexample being [Spotify Wrapped](https://www.spotify.com/us/wrapped/), and recently with other services like \\n[Steam Replay](https://store.steampowered.com/replay). I even got one from Jimmy John\'s today! So I thought it might be\\nkinda neat if I made something similar for Modrunner this year. This project has personally had my time and attention\\nmore than most anything else this year, and it\'s been very rewarding for me. So thank you for using Modrunner, I\'m glad \\nso many find my work useful.\\n\\n## Timeline of Events\\n\\nA lot has happened since Modrunner was initially released in June of this year. Originally launched with the name \\nModrinth Bot, Modrunner initially only supported searching for projects on Modrinth, and did not have any sort of update \\ntracking functionality. Over many  updates using community feedback, Modrunner has grown into a mature project with \\nhundreds of projects tracked for updates across both CurseForge and Modrinth, in many servers of various shapes and \\nsizes. Let\'s take a quick look at the timeline for major improvements made to Modrunner this year:\\n\\n**June**\\n> - Initial release of Modrunner, under the name of \\"Modrinth Bot\\"\\n> - Addition of the ability to track updates to projects\\n> - Addition of support for CurseForge projects\\n\\n**July**\\n> - Addition of buttons on update notifications that link to the new project version on its respective website\\n> - Addition of notification styles, with Normal and Compact mode offered as options\\n> - Addition of changelogs in update notifications\\n\\n**August**\\n> - Improvements to update checking, making Modrunner detect them much faster\\n> - Addition of allowance to track a project in multiple channels at once\\n> - Improvements to the /list command, changing it to use embeds rather than a big block of text\\n> - Migration from hard-coded permissions to Discord\'s built-in permission system\\n> - Many subsequent bug fixes, notably missing notifications for CurseForge projects (this one is still a reason why I don\'t sleep at night)\\n\\n**November**\\n> - Addition of project ID and channel parameters to the /untrack command, for better management of tracked projects\\n> - Addition of channel parameter to the /list command and change of listing projects in alphabetical order\\n> - Addition of new setting to limit the max length of display changelogs in update notifications\\n\\n**December**\\n> - Addition of the ability to add roles to be notified when an update notification is sent\\n> - Addition of support for update notifications in Discord\'s forum channels\\n\\nSomething that I constantly worry about as a developer is thinking that I\'m never doing enough, that I\'m working too\\nslowly or not efficiently enough on something. Looking back on this timeline, and considering everything during this\\nperiod (finishing up my final semester of college), I think that the amount I\'ve accomplished with Modrunner is something\\nto be satisfied with, and I\'m looking forward to adding even more improvements in the future!\\n\\n## Tracked Project Statistics\\n\\nNow, how about some statistics? Big numbers? New records? Everyone loves those, right?\\n\\nAs of this blog post\'s posted date, the project that has been tracked in the greatest amount of times is the Modrinth\\nversion of [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), a modern rendering engine and client-side optimization mod for \\nMinecraft, which has been tracked in **8** different Discord servers, which is over **25.8%** of the servers that Modrunner \\nis present in!\\n\\nThe second-most tracked project is the Modrinth version of [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), a \\nlightweight and modular API providing common hooks and intercompatibility measures utilized by mods using the Fabric \\ntoolchain, which has been tracked in **6** unique servers, or **19.35%** of the total servers Modrunner serves in.\\n\\nHere\'s the top ten tracked projects, as ordered by the number of different servers it\'s tracked in. For projects with\\nthe same number of servers tracked in, they are ordered by total downloads. All the listed projects are for their \\nModrinth versions; guess Modrunner is a popular choice for those working closely with the Modrinth community!\\n\\n| Project Name                                                                  | Project Author | Servers Tracked In | Percentage of Servers Tracked In |\\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|\\n| 1.

[Reese\'s Sodium Options](https://modrinth.com/mod/reeses-sodium-options)   | FlashyReese    | 3                  | 9.68%                            |\\n| 8. [Debugify](https://modrinth.com/mod/debugify)                              | isxander       | 3                  | 9.68%                            |\\n| 9.

[Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized) | robotkoer      | 2                  | 6.45%                            |\\n\\nOverall, Modrunner keeps tabs on **357** unique projects across both CurseForge and Modrinth. That\'s a lot of projects! \\n\\nDespite the top ten tracked projects all being from Modrinth, Modrunner keeps track of more CurseForge projects (**194**)\\nthan it does Modrinth projects (**163**).\\n\\nOf all the **31** servers that Modrunner serves, just **3** of them use the \\"Compact\\" notification style, with the rest\\nof them sticking with using the default Normal style. Additionally, **2** servers have custom changelog lengths, with\\nrest keeping with the default maximum.\\n\\nIn terms of tracked projects, one server has **170** total tracked projects in it, accounting for **47.62%** of the total tracked projects\\nthat Modrunner keeps track of. Most other servers track about **7** projects each on average, and the median amount of\\ntracked projects is just **3**.\\n\\nAnd that\'s the wrap on the 2022 Modrunner recap! This isn\'t the end, of course, for Modrunner and I have many ideas still\\nin store for the bot in the year(s) to come, including some major things like **receiving project updates via direct messages**,\\n**project discoverability features** (maybe a \\"mod of the week\\" kinda thing?) and **localization implementation**, so\\nthat everyone can enjoy and use Modrunner in their language of choice. Look out for these features in the near future!\\n\\nThanks again and let\'s have a great 2023!\\n- Shane, aka beansquared"},{"id":"/2022/12/21/minor-update-before-christmas","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/12/21/minor-update-before-christmas","source":"@site/blog/2022-12-21-minor-update-before-christmas.md","title":"The Minor Update Before Christmas","description":"An early holiday update bringing a few new nifty features and a couple of bugfixes","date":"2022-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 21, 2022","tags":[],"readingTime":1.045,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"beansquared","title":"Modrunner Lead Developer","url":"https://github.com/smcmo","imageURL":"https://github.com/smcmo.png","key":"beansquared"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"The Minor Update Before Christmas","description":"An early holiday update bringing a few new nifty features and a couple of bugfixes","authors":"beansquared","date":"2022-12-21T00:00:00.000Z"},"prevItem":{"title":"Modrunner End-of-Year Recap","permalink":"/blog/2022/12/29/modrunner-recap-2022"}},"content":"Hey Modrunnerians (?)\\n\\nGot a small little update for y\'all just before the holidays hit (and before a big snowstorm where I live!). Wanted to\\npush some new minor features before taking a short break from working on Modrunner, so here it is. Please let me know\\nwhat you think! \\n\\nNow, the changes:\\n\\n- **Add roles to be pinged for updates** - you can now add roles to be pinged by Modrunner when a project receives an\\nupdate notification. These are project-channel specific, meaning you can pick separate roles for every single project you\\nhave tracked, if you\'d like. You can even ping multiple roles at once! Head over to the docs on the \\ntrack command to get started adding ping roles to your tracked projects.\\n- **Support for forum channels** - you can now track projects in forum channels! Every time a project receives an update\\nin a forum channel, the bot will create a new post for that notification, making these ideal for setups where you wish to\\nencourage discussion about newly released project updates.\\n- **Added some stability checks and fixed some bugs** - check the release notes on the releases tab to view\\nthe specifics, if you\'re so inclined.\\n\\nHappy Holidays from the Modrunner team!"}]}')}}]);
