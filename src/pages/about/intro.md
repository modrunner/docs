# What is Modrunner?

Modrunner is a bot that allows users on [Discord](https://discord.com/) to locate information on and track updates of, modding projects on a variety of online platforms such as CurseForge and Modrinth. This allows users to easily find and share information about modding projects with others, and to know when their favorite projects recieve updates to their files.

To get started with using Modrunner, please visit the [Guides](../v1/guides) section.
