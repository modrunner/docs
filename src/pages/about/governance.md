# Modrunner Governance

## Organizational Structure

Modrunner is developed and governed by the CyberMechanics. The CyberMechanics Studio manages a number of projects, and not every member of the team works on every project equally or sometimes at all. Addtionally, many members of the open source community have worked on Modrunner as well, and their contributions to the project are just as important as the studio's. Ultimately, however, the studio manages and directs the development of Modrunner using community contribution and feedback.

You can come talk to CyberMechanics staff in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fm88jhzEbt) with any questions.

## Licensing

Modrunner, its assets and its associated projects are licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/smcmo/modrunner-bot/blob/main/LICENSE).
